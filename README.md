# ScreenSplash

ScreenSplash is an open source MERN stack Ecommerce application. When entering the website, users are able to purchase various wallpapers that can be used on their computer and smartphone screens.

## Project Brainstorm

The Goal of this project is to build a fully working Ecommerce MERN application with payment integrations. The user of this app will be anyone who wants affordable computer and smartphone screen wallpapers. I am planning on learning the payment integration through a course created by [Brad Traversey](https://www.traversymedia.com/mern-stack-from-scratch) The main roadblock I see is developing a way for the end-user to only be able to download the wallpapers once the payment has been processed.
